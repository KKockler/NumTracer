# Tutorials

The tutorials are a **numbered series**. Each step is a complete, runnable, self-checking program
plus the narrative that explains it, and each builds on concepts introduced earlier. Step 1 assumes
nothing but a C++ compiler; by step 22 you are generating GPU kernels for four-point vertex flows
and validating them against independent oracles.

Every step follows the same four-part shape:

1. **Introduction** — the problem, the mathematics, and *why* the API is shaped the way it is.
2. **The commented program** — the real source, walked through chunk by chunk.
3. **Results** — the program's actual output, and what to notice in it.
4. **Possibilities for extensions** — graduated exercises, including at least one deliberate
   breakage so you learn to read the engine's error messages.

```{admonition} New here? Read these two pages first
:class: tip
[**Key concepts**](../getting_started/concepts.md) defines how a network is described — indices
contract when they share a label, the frame fixes each momentum's components, scalar products
become the kernel's symbols. [**Scope & conventions**](../getting_started/scope-and-conventions.md)
states the hard assumptions (4 dimensions, **Euclidean** metric, chiral-basis gammas).
```

```{admonition} Not here for QCD?
:class: note
The worked examples are quantum-field-theory loop integrands, because that is what the authors
needed traced. The engine itself knows no physics — it contracts indices. Steps 1–9 use almost no
physics vocabulary; [**Bring your own network**](../getting_started/bring-your-own-network.md) is
the domain-neutral on-ramp, and the [**Glossary**](../getting_started/glossary.md) marks which
terms are *engine* concepts and which are merely the example's vocabulary.
```

## Connections between the tutorial programs

Each arrow means "introduces a concept the later step relies on". Nothing forces you to read in
order — pick a target and walk back along its arrows.

## What each step needs

The series is deliberately layered so that the early steps have **no dependencies beyond a C++
compiler**. Every step states its tier at the top.

| Tier | Requirements | Steps |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | A C++20 compiler and CMake. Nothing else. | 1–5, 16, 17, 18 |
| **B** | …plus a Wolfram kernel and [FunKit](https://github.com/satfra/FunKit). The scripts build their networks *by hand*, so no TensorBases, no FORM, no DiFfRG. | 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 21 |
| **C** | …plus TensorBases and DiFfRG — the rest of the fRG toolchain. | 10–15, 20, 22 |

```{admonition} Why tier B needs FunKit
:class: note
NumTracer owns the *tensor* half of code generation. The *scalar* half — expression formatting,
CSE of the dressing coefficients, and all the function/class/header boilerplate — is delegated to
FunKit's mature COEN emitter rather than reimplemented. So `NumTrace` will analyse a network
without FunKit, but `MakeNTKernel` cannot write a kernel without it. **FORM is never needed** for
your own kernels; it enters only when regenerating the project's committed reference flows, where
FunKit uses it to compute tensor *bases* — never to do NumTracer's trace.
```

## Building and running the programs

The programs live in the repository's `Tutorials/` folder as a **standalone CMake project** that
consumes NumTracer the way any external user would (`find_package(NumTracer)`, with a fallback to
the in-tree library so it also works straight from a checkout):

```bash
cd Tutorials
cmake -S . -B build            # configure once
cmake --build build -j4        # build every tier-A tutorial
ctest --test-dir build         # run them all as a self-checking test suite
```

Tier-B steps additionally generate their kernels through Wolfram. They are wired into the same
project but only when a Wolfram kernel is on `PATH`:

```bash
cmake --build build --target tutorials_codegen   # run every codegen tutorial
ctest --test-dir build                           # now includes the tier-B checks
```

Each page also gives the one-target command (`cmake --build build --target <name>`) and the
program's real output.

```{admonition} The code on these pages is the code that runs
:class: important
Every listing is pulled directly out of the file in `Tutorials/` at documentation-build time — the
pages cannot drift from the programs `ctest` executes. If a listing looks wrong, the program is
wrong, and `ctest` will say so.
```
